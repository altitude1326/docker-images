# Dell OpenManage

Dockerized OpenManage Server Administrator (OMSA), built on top of [official CentOS](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/centos/) images.

## Configuration

  - container has to run in privilged mode so that the host hardware can be exposed to it.
  - specifying `--net=host` exposes the host's network interfaces to the container, otherwise they will not be available.
  - default command: `/opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin/srvadmin-services.sh restart` so that services can start cleanly in case container is stopped and then restarted.
  - login credentials: root / password

## Where this image has been tested (some more than others)

  - RHEL 7
  - SLES 12
  - CentOS 7
  - Ubuntu Server 12.04 & 14.04
  - Debian 7 / 8

## Run example

```bash
$ docker run --privileged -d -p 1311:1311 --restart=always \
    --net=host -v /lib/modules/`uname -r`:/lib/modules/`uname -r` \
    --name=omsa82 jdelaros1/openmanage
```

Testing without volume mounting /lib/modules resulted in mixed results across different servers, so I added this requirement back.

Once the container starts, give it about 20-25 seconds for all the OpenManage services to start inside the container.

## Usage examples

You can monitor your server by going to https://your-server:1311. Use the login credentials given above. You can also run commands from a command console:

$ docker run --privileged -d -p 161:161/udp -p 1311:1311 --restart=always \
    -v /lib/modules/`uname -r`:/lib/modules/`uname -r` \
    --name=omsa82 jdelaros1/openmanage
```
